 This directory (cnceleb) contains example scripts for CN-Celeb 
 speaker verification.  The CN-Celeb corpus is required, and can be
 downloaded from OpenSLR http://www.openslr.org/82/.

 The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different speaker recognition
 recipes. The recipe in v1 demonstrates a standard x-vector model 
 using TDNN backbone with PLDA backend.  The example in v2 demonstrates 
 a more powerful x-vector model using ResNet34 backbone with Cosine backend.

 Moreover, the example in v3 demonstrates a ResNet34-based x-vector model 
 for CN-Celeb speaker retrieval.
