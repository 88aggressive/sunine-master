 This is a Kaldi recipe for speaker verification using the VoxCeleb1 and
 VoxCeleb2 corpora.  See http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/ and 
 http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb2/ for additional details and
 information on how to obtain them.

 The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different speaker recognition
 recipes. The recipe in v1 demonstrates a standard x-vector model 
 using TDNN backbone with Cosine backend.  The example in v2 demonstrates 
 a more powerful x-vector model using ResNet34 backbone with Cosine backend.
